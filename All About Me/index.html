		<h2>Being Accepted Into a Magnet Middle School</h2>
		<p>I love science and computer science. I had found out about a magnet middle school that specialized in computer science, science, and math. I had to apply! Once I did, I had taken the test, and was accepted! I had done it! It was incredible. At this middle school I learned a lot about coding, how a computer "thinks, and the basics to many different languages. </p>
		
		<h2>Meeting Theaster Gates</h2>
		<p>I am a member of the Hirshhorn Museum's Artlab+ community. One day, Artlab asked if I wanted to meet a famous black artist from Chicago. I had immediatly responded yes, I was willing to go. My parents had to take me from sleep away camp in Virginia to meet with him in D.C. It was amazing! He had lots of information about how he gets his ideas for art. He doesn't consider himself an artist, just a creator of art.</p>
		
		<h2>Meeting Secretary Skorton</h2>
		<p>Back during the summer of 2016, I had come in to Artlab+ one day to meet Secretary David Skorton, head of the Smithsonian Institution. He had come to visit Artlab to get a sense of what us kids were doing there. In a way, he came to meet me! That was truly amazing!</p>
		
		<h2>Participating in the Montgomery County Science Fair</h2>
		<p>For the years of 2016-2017, I have participated in ScienceMontgomery's annual science fair. After preparing a tri-fold board on my project, I would present in front of judges focused on my scientific category. Although I did not recieve any awards, I did gain lots of experience in learning how to make an impression on people and sell my product.</p>
		
		<h2>Becoming a Part of Mr.Shack's Coding Class</h2>
		<p>It is a true honor to be a part of this coding class. I can't wait to use the lessons I learn in there out in the world. Mr. Shack isn't just teaching us to code, he's also teaching us to be included, stay tentative, be prepared, and to be a team. These are what make Mr. Shack's classes different from taking "any coding class." This is why I believe it is an honor to be a part of his classes.</p></div>
